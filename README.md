# Portfolio E-Commerce

### Website: [Breadcrumb E-commerce](https://breadcrumb.andrenovado.my.id)


This repository is created as part of an individual project during Alterra Academy Software Engineer bootcamp. I was asked to create an e-commerce, and this repository is the front-end half.

The idea of this e-commerce is to provide a platform to help bakers sell their high quality products to customers.
The technologies used in this project are the following:
- Front-End:
  - React with Redux
  - HTML & CSS
  - Bootstrap
- Back-End:
  - RESTful API with Python Flask
- Database:
  - MySQL

The features of my e-commerce are:
- User Login and Registration
- Edit profile
- Filter product by category
- Add multiple products to cart
- Checkout transaction from cart
- Dashboard Seller:
  - Add, edit, delete product
  - Get all products posted by themself
  - Get all history transaction from their shop
- Dashboard Admin:
  - Get all existing user
  - Delete user
  - Add new payment method
  - Add new shipping method
